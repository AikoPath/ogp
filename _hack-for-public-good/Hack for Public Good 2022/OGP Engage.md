#### What is OGP Engage?
Engage with OGP officers on telegram!

#### What motivated you to build this product?
I realised there is a lack of ad-hoc communication between OGP and agencies on the ground level. The problem we're trying to solve is to bridge the gap with telegram.

#### What tech stack did you use?
Telegram

#### What were the key challenges you faced in building OGP Engage? 

To get users join our telegram group chat was and still is the challenge.

#### What is the product vision for OGP Engage? 
If each products in OGP started to get a large amount of users, we can create a telegram group chat for each of this product to better engage with users directly to understand their pain points and use case better.

#### Fun facts!
**One interesting finding:**\\
Cpf.gov.sg actually built something similar to go.gov.sg. Something that Nat and I weren't aware of.

**One thing you'd have done differently:**\\
We would want to market the telegram channel better and also create more interactive content to engage with our users on a weekly basis.

**Takeaway/learnings:**\\
There are a tons of things happening with other agencies which OGP could really help.
