## Distribute Instantaneous COVID-19 Updates

*Insert  Postman Logo here*

When COVID-19 first hit Singapore, there was a significant number of false information spreading around which brought about anxiety and uncertainty among the citizens. Thus, there was a need for government agencies to provide accurate and up-to-date information through the channels that citizens were already using. 

In 3 days, we built a modular omnichannel communication tool, Postman which enabled agencies to quickly scale their communication needs and allowed them to distribute critical information across multiple channels.


#### Our Impact
* Disseminated COVID-19 related announcements daily to over 1 million subscribers on Gov.sg Whatsapp (Read more [here](https://govinsider.asia/innovation/singapore-coronavirus-whatsapp-covid19-open-government-products-govtech/))
* Helped teachers communicate with students at home for home-based learning
* Notified citizens of changes in government agency appointments
* Enabled Ministry of Health's Healthcare Corps to better manage COVID-19 volunteers

## Distribute Masks Across the Nation

With the shortage and uneven distribution of masks across the nation at the start of the pandemic, there was a pressing need to develop a fast and cost-efficient way of distributing masks to citizens.

Working with government agencies, we integrated RedeemSG's system in over 1000 mask vending machines to ensure that citizens can easily redeem their masks in their neighbourhood. 

#### Our Impact
* Facilitated over 14 million mask redemptions islandwide across 4 Mask Distribution Campaigns

## Ensure Compliance of Quarantine Orders

*Insert Homer and Postman logo*

Homer was launched as a hackathon project during COVID-19 as a way to help reduce the spread of the virus by ensuring that potential carriers comply with their quarantine orders or stay home notices. The monitoring can be done in 2 ways: 

**(1) The Spot-check Method**

Sending SMSes at random times of the day containing a unique link. Users simply click on the link to share their current location.

**(2) The Constant Monitoring Solution**

Installation of an application on the users’ phones. The app automatically sends location reports every 5 minutes to the server. Users are also asked to submit health reports multiple times a day, together with a selfie for identification purposes.

With both solutions, data is reported to a dashboard for enforcement officers’ review. The system is currently used by the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Education (MOE), Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (ICA) and Ministry of Manpower (MOM).


#### Our Impact
* Ensured compliance of over x Stay Home Notice (SHN) and Quarantine Orders
