Since January 2020, the team has had to develop and adapt a number of digital tools to help Singapore fight the spread of COVID-19 and adjust to the constantly evolving situation. 

Learn more about how weâ€™ve helped Singapore respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and how we are open sourcing our products to help other countries with common challenges below.

## Distribute Instantaneous COVID-19 Updates

When COVID-19 first hit Singapore, there was a significant number of false information spreading around which brought about anxiety and uncertainty among the citizens. Thus, there was a need for government agencies to provide accurate and up-to-date information through the channels that citizens were already using. 

In 3 days, we built a modular omnichannel communication tool, Postman which enabled agencies to quickly scale their communication needs and allowed them to distribute critical information across multiple channels.


#### Our Impact
* Disseminated COVID-19 related announcements daily to over 1 million subscribers on Gov.sg Whatsapp (Read more [here](https://govinsider.asia/innovation/singapore-coronavirus-whatsapp-covid19-open-government-products-govtech/))
* Helped teachers communicate with students at home for home-based learning
* Notified citizens of changes in government agency appointments
* Enabled Ministry of Health's Healthcare Corps to better manage COVID-19 volunteers

## Distribute Masks Across the Nation

With the shortage and uneven distribution of masks across the nation during the pandemic, there was a pressing need to develop a fast and cost-efficient way of distributing masks to citizens.

Working with government agencies, we integrated RedeemSG's system in over 1000 mask vending machines to ensure that citizens can easily redeem their masks in their neighbourhood. 

#### Our Impact
* Facilitated over 14 million mask redemptions across 4 Mask Distribution Campaigns
