Since January 2020, the team has had to develop and adapt a number of digital tools to help Singapore fight the spread of COVID-19 and adjust to the constantly evolving situation. 

Learn more about how we’ve helped Singapore respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and how we are open sourcing our products to help other countries with common challenges below.

## Distribute Instantaneous COVID-19 Updates

*Insert  Postman, Isomer Logo here*

When COVID-19 first hit Singapore, there was a significant number of false information spreading around, which brought about anxiety and uncertainty among the citizens. As a result, government agencies had to look for a way to disseminate accurate and up-to-date information through the channels that citizens were already using. 

In 3 days, we built a modular omnichannel communication tool, [Postman](https://www.open.gov.sg/products/postman/) which enabled agencies to quickly scale their communication needs and allowed them to distribute critical information across multiple channels.

In addition, [Isomer](https://www.open.gov.sg/products/isomer/) was used to build website pages for COVID-19 campaigns such as [sgunited.gov.sg](sgunited.gov.sg) and [safetravel.ica.gov.sg](safetravel.ica.gov.sg). The easy-to-deploy feature of Isomer allowed government agencies to build up these websites within a short period of time given the urgency of the campaigns.

## Distribute Masks Across the Nation

*Insert Redeem logo here*

With the shortage and uneven distribution of masks across the nation at the start of the pandemic, there was a pressing need to develop a fast and cost-efficient way of distributing masks to citizens.

Working with government agencies, we integrated RedeemSG's system in over 1000 mask vending machines to ensure that citizens can easily redeem their masks in their neighbourhood. 

#### Our Impact
* Facilitated over 14 million mask redemptions islandwide across 4 Mask Distribution Campaigns

## Ensure Compliance of Quarantine Orders

*Insert Homer and Postman logo*

Homer was launched as a hackathon project during COVID-19 as a way to help reduce the spread of the virus by ensuring that potential carriers comply with their quarantine orders or stay home notices. The monitoring can be done in 2 ways: 

**(1) The Spot-check Method**

Sending SMSes at random times of the day containing a unique link. Users simply click on the link to share their current location.

**(2) The Constant Monitoring Solution**

Installation of an application on the users’ phones. The app automatically sends location reports every 5 minutes to the server. Users are also asked to submit health reports multiple times a day, together with a selfie for identification purposes.

With both solutions, data is reported to a dashboard for enforcement officers’ review. The system is currently used by the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Education (MOE), Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (ICA) and Ministry of Manpower (MOM).


#### Our Impact
* Ensured compliance of over x Stay Home Notice (SHN) and Quarantine Orders

## Facilitate Appointment Booking for Vaccination

*Insert Vaccination, Postman, Forms, Isomer, Vault logo*

When Vaccines were finally available in Singapore in Dec 2020, there was a need for a fast and efficient way to ensure citizens can get their jabs as soon as possible. Since then, OGP has worked closely with the Ministry of Health to launch the National COVID-19 Vaccine Appointment System to ensure smooth running of the Vaccination deployment.

With the system in place, citizens will receive a unique vaccination registration link through [Postman](https://www.open.gov.sg/products/postman/) when it is their turn to receive the vaccination. With the link, citizens can easily input their personal information and register for a vaccination slot at the nearest Vaccination Centre. Information regarding vaccination can also be found on the VaccinationSG website, built with [Isomer](https://www.open.gov.sg/products/isomer/).

On the end of Health Officers, the Appointment system allows...
