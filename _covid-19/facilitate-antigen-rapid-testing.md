### Border Entry and Pre-event Antigen Rapid Testing (ART) System 


#### Background 

Antigen rapid tests (ART) are administered at point of entry to  Singapore borders and at large-scale events. Compared to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab test which takes between 1-3 days for test results to be available, ART tests take under 30 minutes. There is a need for an end-to-end solution that registers individuals being tested, uniquely tags them to a test kit, collects their test results, and thereafter sends results in a timely way  to both attendees and public health authorities. 
As public health actions may be taken for Antigen positive cases, it was critical for both patients and the Ministry of Health to be notified of results real-time.


#### Solution

An intuitive registration form that contains: i)  QR code for patients to uniquely identify themselves and associate their identity with  a test kit results via an online form; ii) Barcode stickers for swab test staff to serialise test kits
* This registration form and the test cartridge reader is integrated with the Covid-19 Management Backbone. Upon completion of an ART test,  patients are notified real-time on an online checker and via SMS notifications
* Public health authorities are notified real-time when an Antigen-positive case is detected



#### Impact

* Administered > 1 million Antigen Rapid Tests at border checkpoints and large-scale events
* Supported public health authorities in timely conveyance of Antigen-positve patients
