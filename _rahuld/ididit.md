### **Who we are**

Open Government Products is an in-house team of cool engineers, designers, and product managers who build technology for the public good. We proactively identify areas where technology can help, test our prototypes with actual users, and bring our best ones to launch. This includes everything from building better frontend applications for citizens, to automating the internal operations of public agencies. We use and release open source software, keep a flat hierarchy, and bypass bureaucracy to focus on delivery. We work on real problems, build for the user, and push for change.

Projects we have worked on include:

**Data.gov.sg** - An open repository of all the Singapore Government's public data. It helps people understand the data using visualizations and articles, and provides real-time APIs for developers to use.

**Beeline** - A data-driven shuttle bus platform. Bus routes are created from user suggestions and public transport usage data. Users can book, pay for, and track rides using a mobile app.

**Parking.sg** - A mobile app alternative to parking coupons. It lets users pay, extend, and refund their parking sessions just using their phones.

**Form.sg** - A form builder tool for agencies to self-service and create online forms that capture classified data, with the goal of replacing paper forms.

### **What does a Product Manager do?**
As a product manager, your job is to make sure the right things get done. At a high level, this means establishing a clear vision for what a product should be and what needs to be done to get there. On a day to day basis, this means handling all the different facets of a project and making sure theyâ€™re coordinated. And at the core, this means building a foundation of knowledge across user needs, technical constraints, and design goals so you can act as a bridge across all of them.

Concretely this means:

* Understanding users better than anyone else
* Conducting user studies to understand their needs and problems
* Analyzing data to uncover usage patterns that inform product decisions
* Researching the industry to understand existing solutions
* Keeping things organized
