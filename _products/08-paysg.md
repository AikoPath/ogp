### Digitise payments for government agencies  

#### Background 

Developed to enable digital payments for COVID-19 swab tests and Stay-Home Notices for incoming travellers to Singapore. 


#### Approach

* Users will receive a personalised payment link sent to their email. They will then go to a personalised payment page that includes some details submitted at point of entry application. Upon checkout, they will receive a personalised invoice/receipt with details that they can show government officers to prove that they have paid. 
* There are various channels through which links can be generated - users filling forms on FormSG directly, government officers filling in a FormSG form, or a script that generates links to be sent in bulk.
* PaySG uses FormSGâ€™s webhook feature, Stripe for payment processing, and Postmark for transactional email templates and sending. 


#### Impact

* ~2 weeks - time taken to develop PaySG
* In the 2 months since launch on 17 Jun 2020:
  * S$61M volume of payments that our links have enabled
  * 47k successful transactions and payment links sent out
  * 8 agencies/ministries using PaySG
