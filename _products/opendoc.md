### Openly accessible documents from the Singapore Government

#### Background 

There are three key problems encountered with public documents distributed by government agencies: 
* Multiple outdated versions of the same document could be in circulation 
* Difficult to track changes in the documents that are updated on a regular basis
* These documents cannot be analysed and are not searchable since they are neither in machine-readable nor proprietary formats


#### Solution

OpenDoc aims to organise the Governmentâ€™s documents and make it accessible and useful. 
* Responsive design: Documents adapt to all types of devices, allowing for comfortable viewing on any device
* Powerful search: Complex searches are executed extremely fast and users are able to access relevant information quickly and accurately
* Fast, secure and scalable: Public servants can modify, track changes and submit edit requests easily on the platform

#### Impact

Used by the Supreme Court, State Courts, Family Justice Courts, Attorney-General's Chambers, Ministry of Defence, Government Technology Agency
