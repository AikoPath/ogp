### Openly accessible documents from the Singapore Government

#### Background 

There are three key problems encountered with public documents distributed by government agencies: 
* Multiple outdated versions of the same document could be in circulation 
* Difficult to track changes in the documents when they are updated on a regular basis
* These documents cannot be analysed and is not searchable since these documents are in non machine-readable or proprietary formats


#### Approach

OpenDoc aims to organise the Governmentâ€™s documents and make it accessible and useful. 
* Responsive design: Documents adapt to all types of devices, allowing for comfortable viewing whichever device you use
* Powerful search: Complex searches are executed extremely fast and users are able to access relevant information quickly and more accurately
* Fast, secure and scalable: Public servants can modify, track changes and submit edit requests easily on the platform. 

#### Impact
