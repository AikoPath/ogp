### Create official government links in seconds

#### Background 

Long URLs directed to websites and digital forms are difficult to read and takes up space. Public link shorteners lack government branding and could expose members of the public to phishing attacks. 

#### Approach

Go is built to provide the public service with a trustworthy link shortener.

* Anti-phishing from legitimate .gov.sg domain lets citizens know they are assessing a government resource
* Saves time as it typically takes 3-7 man days to shorten to agency domain
* Usage analytics to track click trends across all government links

#### Impact

* 2,335 public officers across 70 agencies
* 10,000+ links shortened
* 1.2 million link clicks
