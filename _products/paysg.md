### Digitise payments for government agencies  

#### Background 
As the economy gradually opens up, Singapore intends to charge inbound travellers for their swab tests and hotel stay if they are quarantined in Singapore. However, there are 3 key problems surrounding e-payments in the government: 
* It typically takes between 6 weeks and 9 months to set up a new payment service
* It is costly to set up new payment services
* There is a need for manual financial reconciliation


#### Solution
PaySG was developed to enable digital payments for COVID-19 swab tests and Stay-Home Notices for incoming travellers to Singapore. 
* Users will receive a personalised payment link sent to their email. They will then go to a personalised payment page that includes some details submitted at point of entry application. Upon checkout, they will receive a personalised invoice/receipt with details that they can show government officers to prove that they have paid
* There are various channels through which links can be generated - users filling forms on FormSG directly, government officers filling in a FormSG form, or a script that generates links to be sent in bulk
* PaySG uses FormSGâ€™s webhook feature, Stripe for payment processing, and Postmark for transactional email templates and sending




#### Impact

*  Facilitated more than 234 payment transactions since Jun 2020
*  Enabled 8 agencies to collected more than S$250 million in Stay-Home-Notice and Swab-related payments
