### Digital medical certificates with assured authenticity

#### Background 

Medical certificates are given to patients today as official exemptions from work, school, and sometimes even court, and are also used as supporting documents for insurance claims. Given that they are traditionally distributed as hardcopy certificates without a fixed format, medical certificates are susceptible to alteration and easy to misplace. 

#### Solution

DigiMC integrates with EMR systems from public and private healthcare institutions to form a central repository of medical certificates. Patients receive their MCs in the form of a weblink, which requires a date of birth verification before they are unlocked. Patients can then forward this MC URL to their schools/employers. Employers can be assured that the MCs are legitimate given that they are hosted on a government website.

#### Impact

* Integrated with > 300 public and private healthcare institutions
* Issued > 2 million MCs till date
