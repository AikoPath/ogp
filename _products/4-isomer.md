### A static website building and hosting solution for the public service

#### Background 

An internal study conducted by the Singapore government in 2017 found that over one-third of our government websites failed basic usability checks. Other problems include: 

* Website downtime: Cases of government sites not accessible for hours in any given month. 
* Poor UX: Many had outdated designs that does not work well on mobile devices and not accessible to persons with visual impairments. 
* Slow: Certain sites took more than 10 seconds to load, when modern sites should never take more than 2 seconds. 
* Expensive: A simple website can cost the Singapore government upwards of S$65,000 per year, racking a hefty bill across the government.

#### Approach

The aim was to build a service to help Singapore government websites look better, run faster, and more secure — all at a low cost. Isomer provides government agencies with an easy-to-deploy static website building and hosting service to create usable informational websites quickly. Isomer offers the following value propositions:

* Pre-tested user interface to be usable and accessible to people with disabilities
* Static site architecture allows for fast loading and eliminates many vulnerabilities
* Automated monitoring improves reliability and security

#### Impact

* 26 websites launched
* S$3.4 million realised cost savings
* 99.99% availability (100x reduction in downtime)
