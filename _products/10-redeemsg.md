### Redemption tracking system to monitor the distribution of goods, tickets and vouchers in real time.

#### Background 

Previously, tracking of redemptions was a time consuming process that included logging records on paper and counting and keying in records into a digital system. With RedeemSG, agencies can easily track the redemption of goods and vouchers. 


#### Approach

* Admin portal allows agencies and non-profit organizations to see statistics and redemption status and download reports. No more manual tracking. 
* Mobile app allows staff and volunteers to log redemptions via scanning a personâ€™s NRIC or voucher. 
* API allows merchants to integrate and update redemption for government and non-profit programmes 
* System also digitises vouchers that are sent to recipients via SMS and open up in a web link. No need for an app or smart phone to receive a voucher. Also allows agencies to avoid printing costs.


#### Impact

* More than 11 million redemptions across 7 national campaigns, including nation-wide mask distribution and SG Together pack distribution, NDP e-tickets and Buka Puasa meal distribution
* Used by >14K volunteers, connected with >1K vending machines for the mask distribution exercise
