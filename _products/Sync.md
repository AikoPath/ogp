### Keep your COVID-19 records in sync

#### Background 

In line with the Singapore government’s strategy to live endemically with COVID-19, Sync is a web platform that enables consent-based sharing of COVID-19 test results and vaccination records. Developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, Sync allows individuals to easily share their COVID-19 records with employers and other organisations and control access rights. In addition, Sync helps employers identify COVID-19 cases within their organisations in a more timely manner, allowing for public health measures to be implemented swiftly across workplace and community settings. 


#### Solution
* Near real-time sharing of COVID-19 records between individuals and employers through web platform
* Daily consolidated reports of COVID-19 test results and records for easy monitoring of workplace health and safety
* Users can share specific COVID-19 records on a subscription basis, accepting or withdrawing consent anytime





#### Impact

* More than 154,000 users across 492 organisations
* Dr. David Foo, Medical Director at National Healthcare Group Heart Institute, said that [“Sync is quick and easy to use, needing only a total of three mouse clicks to submit an ART result”](https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/tech-news/online-platform-to-offer-employees-simpler-way-of-sharing-covid-19-test-results-vaccination-records) and that ["compared to the previous user flow with FormSG, the time taken to submit a test result or record has reduced from 30s to about 10s"](https://www.8world.com/singapore/sync-platform-for-sharing-covid-test-result-and-vaccination-status-1728451)
