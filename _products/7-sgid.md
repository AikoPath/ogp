### Privacy-based authentication system

#### Background 

The average person could share their NRIC with businesses and organisations at least once a month -- for visitor registrations, lucky draw and loyalty programme sign-ups, in-app identity verification, and more. For a citizen to share their identity wholesale by providing the physical NRIC to this many third parties exposes them to identity fraud and other security risks.

#### Approach

sg-ID helps citizens stay in control of their personal information. The solution employs a zero-knowledge protocol, which means that any user data that passes through our servers is encrypted and never stored. Each business is provided with a unique identifier for every user that authenticates using sgID, and this makes it harder to track you across businesses.

* Unique identifier is generated for every business
* Citizens have complete control access to their data
* Citizens have physical ownership through zero-knowledge architecture
* Simple drop-in integration for SMEs and businesses
