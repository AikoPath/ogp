## Open repository for Singapore’s public data 

![github](/images/data-mockup.PNG)

#### Background 

In line with Singapore’s vision to be a smart nation, data.gov.sg was launched in 2011 as a repository of data collected by 70 public agencies made accessible openly and freely to citizens and developers, with the aim of co-creating useful solutions. APIs to real-time public data are also provided to aid the development of mobile and web applications.  

To help citizens and laymen better understand public data, data.gov.sg provides interactive dashboards, visualisations, and articles in the current iteration of the product.

#### Approach

* Dashboards & data visualisations allow users to intuitively understand public data without needing to be a data scientist
* Automatic data standard validation ensures datasets are usable and interoperable
* Search and data previews improve discoverability and accessibility of the datasets

#### Impact

* 350,000 monthly visitors
* 30,000 data downloads
* 13 million API calls
