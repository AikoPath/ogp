#### What is Anything Mapper
Upload a list of locations & characteristics, and convert it into a map that others can search and filter!

#### Why Anything Mapper?
We realised existing map products didnâ€™t allow you to easily filter for specific characteristics. We wanted an easy way to upload a list of locations and their characteristics (e.g. mosques, restrooms) and then convert that into a searchable, filterable map.

#### What was the biggest challenge in this project? 
Having enough time to work on it!


#### Fun facts!
**One interesting finding:**\\
There are actually many potential use cases for filterable maps.

**One thing you'd have done differently:**\\
Reached out more to other agencies to find and better understand potential use cases for the product.
