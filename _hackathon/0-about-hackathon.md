How did products like Go.gov.sg (the official government link shortener),  Postman.gov.sg (powers the Gov.SG WhatsApp), and RedeemSG (used to distribute millions of face masks to Singaporeans) come about? They were all ideas born and developed through Open Government Products’ annual Hackathon. 

Every year in January Open Government Products conducts a month-long hackathon to build products to solve real public sector issues. Unlike many other hackathons, the focus for OGP Hackathon is to generate new ideas for OGP products and to have working prototypes by the end of the month. Hackathon also provides an opportunity for OGP members to learn and develop new skills as they work to build new products.

For the entire month, OGP officers pause non-core projects to work on whatever public good problem that interests them. Hackathon starts with the team’s annual retreat, where OGP members discuss their vision for where they want and see OGP going forward in the upcoming year. Then the team embarks on learning journeys within the community to understand what it’s like for other public officers on the ground and what are the problems and opportunities people commonly face.

Once teams identify a problem they want to work on, they then spend the rest of the month building and prototyping solutions. Hackathon culminates at the end of the month with groups presenting their final working prototypes at Hackathon Finale.
