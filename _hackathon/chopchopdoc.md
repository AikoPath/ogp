#### What is ChopChopDoc
ChopChopDoc allows the information entered via a customizable form to automatically populate a pre-generated Word template, which is then sent directly to your inbox. Especially for legal and corporate teams, this is a huge time-saver as technical documents are full of jargon, and difficult to fill out for the average layman. 

#### What motivated you to build ChopChopDoc?
CPF initiated this product within their own team, and wanted help with distribution. They onboarded their legal and procurement teams on to their Python solution, and were able to reap substantial time-savings through this. Hence, we felt that the project had a clear value for not only public officers on the ground, but also for businesses and citizens, and adopting it could set a precedent for more ground-up tech initiatives. 

It also helped that the project had a very well-defined scope and already had potential use-cases amongst other agencies, hence we were confident that we could build a useful prototype within the time constraints of the hackathon.

#### Biggest challenges
**Engineering challenges:**\\
Typescript! We decided to use Typescript for the first time, and that learning curve was fairly steep considering that we were also pressed for time. 

**Product Management & User Research challenges:**\\
We could have done better in picking up on nuances in user interviews and really drilling down to how users were likely to use the product.

#### Fun facts!
**One thing you're most proud of accomplishing:**\\
It was a completely engineering-run team, and we managed to do the product management, design, and research aspects ourselves (passably well)!

**One interesting finding:**\\
CPF Automation labs onboarded their internal legal and procurement teams onto Python! More than 1000 people within CPF has used their Python form generator.

**One thing you'd have done differently:**\\
We could have used some expertises in design, user research, and product management. Our early stage prototypes looked like early-2000s web designs:

#### Others
Shout outs to Bing Wen, Chang Qing and Dorcas at CPF Automation Labs, for the original idea & for being really supportive agency partners and for setting up interviews with other potential agency users!
