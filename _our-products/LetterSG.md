### Trusted e-letters from the Singapore Government

#### Background 

For citizens, managing physical mail is burdensome. It is easy to miss important official letters, forget to take them when needed, and it can be hard to throw them away because they contain private information.

As a public officer, current methods for generating and sending letters are suboptimal. Processes like Microsoft Mail Merge require multiple steps, while other enterprise systems involve extended turnaround times when collaborating with vendors. Additionally, physical mail comes with postage expenses and lacks the ability to track letter readability.


#### Solution
LetterSG is a platform for Singapore Government agencies to easily create, issue and track personalised official e-letters to citizens via letters.gov.sg links. 

With LetterSG:
* Letters are hosted on .gov.sg links which enhances legitimacy and trust compared to easily forgeable paper letters
* Agencies can easily generate thousands of letters to send to anyone in minutes using our reusable templates.
* Agencies can cut down on printing and postage expenses by switching from paper letters to e-letters.
