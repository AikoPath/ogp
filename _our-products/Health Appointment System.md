### Find and book vaccine appointments near you

#### Background 

Pneumonia is the third leading cause of death in Singapore, taking away about 4,400 lives in Singapore each year. It's highly preventable via Pneumococcal and flu vaccines, yet less than 10% of Singaporeans above the age of 65 have taken both doses of their Pneumococcal vaccines.

One of the key reasons is accessibilityâ€”"Where do I sign up for vaccines? Do I go to a GP or polyclinic? Can I get an appointment?"

#### Solution

The Health Appointment System (HAS) is a pilot Government initiative to encourage Singaporeans to take the vaccines recommended under the National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS) at their nearest Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) GP clinics.

Our goal is to increase adult vaccination rates by making it easy for Singaporeans to book vaccinations at nearby CHAS clinics.

HAS allows clinics to quickly make available vaccine appointment slots to the general public and facilitate a large volume of appointments in a smooth, hassle-free way. 

#### Launch

Open Government Products will be launching the Health Appointment System in mid-August. 

For the initial launch, the Government will reach out to 600,000 eligible elderly to take their CHAS-subsidised Pneumococcal vaccines (i.e. PCV13 and PPSV23). We will then gradually expand to other NAIS vaccines.

To meet anticipated demand, we are inviting all CHAS clinics to sign up. With HAS, participating clinics can set their availability, allowing Singaporeans to easily find a clinic closest to them with suitable time slots. To find out more, please [sign up](http://go.gov.sg/has-interest-form) for the two Zoom Webinars on: 
*   21 July (Thurs), 1pm
*   23 July (Sat), 2pm
