### People & Hiring
We have individual contributor and manager career schemas for every function in OGP. We use these schemas to make expertise-based hiring and promotion decisions, and pay our people what they're worth in market. We dedicate a day weekly to learning within and across domains so that our people grow in their areas of expertise as well as in working in cross-functional product teams

###Autonomy & Ownership 
We create our own projects from the ground up through our annual hackathon. With building for the user in mind, we prototype quickly and release frequently so as to create meaningful impact

### Open Culture 
We believe in open communication within the team, openly sharing our work and updating approaches with the community through our everyday sharings. We open source products too for the embetterment of public service everywhere
