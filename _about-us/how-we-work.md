### People & Hiring
We hire the best people to work on the most important public problems, and have individual contributor and manager career schemas for every function in OGP. We use these schemas to make expertise-based hiring and promotion decisions, benchmark our compensation rates to top tech companies and pay our people what they're worth in the market. We also dedicate a day weekly to learning within and across domains so that our people grow in their areas of expertise as well as working in cross-functional product teams

### Autonomy & Ownership 
We create our own projects from the ground up through our annual hackathon and are given the autonomy to make decisions for our products. We are also empowered to carry out experimental work while being able to bypass bureaucracy 

### User-Oriented
We make decisions based on what is in the best interest of the user. We observe and respond to urgent and prevalent public needs, prototype quickly, and release frequently so as to create meaning impact for the public through building high-value products


### Open Culture 
We believe in open communication within the team, openly sharing our work and updating approaches with the community through our everyday sharings, as well as being transparent in our decision-making and open sourcing products for the embetterment of public service everywhere
