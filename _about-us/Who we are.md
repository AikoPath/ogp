### A modern tech team working on public sector problems

  
Our role is to accelerate the digital transformation of the Singapore Government by being a space where we can experiment with new tech practices, including new technologies, management techniques, corporate systems, and even cultural norms. Our end goal is that through our work, Singapore becomes a model of how governments can use technology to improve the public good.

### **We build technology for public good.**


We experiment with new practices to develop and demonstrate impactful yet cost-effective tech products that solve public sector problems. This is so that we can propagate our best practices and accelerate the digitalization of the government. We have built solutions to automate work for public good, such as digitising parking, forms, creating trusted communications and simplifying healthcare. We also tackle pressing issues such as fighting scams by blocking unsolicited calls and messages, and also accelerating vaccination rollouts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Problem solving is our core


We solve real problems, build for the user and push for change to maiximise our impact for public good. This means we often take a ground-up approach, empowering individuals to identify problems that can be solved with technology through our annual [Hack for Public Good](/hackathon/2022/). 



In fact, 70% of our products come from the month-long event where we generate new ideas for products, conduct user research and build prototypes to solve problems in the community.


### We build an impactful team for maximum public good impact.

Our people are our most valuable asset in ensuring that we maximise impact for public good, where we base our decisions on how we can best improve the lives of citizens and public officers. To do so, we ensure that we treat our people fairly and communicate openly, and empower them to make good decisions. We also do what needs to be done to deliver impactful work, defined by our mission rather than just the scope of our work. We help each other to have impact as a team as well, where we are unafraid to challenge and criticize to help improve ideas and decisions, while respecting each person’s expertise and rights.
