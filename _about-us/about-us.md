# A modern tech company working on public sector problems  

We are an experimental development team that builds technology for the public good. This includes everything from building better apps for citizens to automating the internal operations of public agencies. Our role is to accelerate the digital transformation of the Singapore Government by being a space where it can experiment with new tech practices. Our end goal is that through our work, Singapore becomes a model of how governments can use technology can improve the public good.


## Our Mission

1. **EXPERIMENT** with new practices with the goal of developing good tech products that solve public sector problems.
2. **DEMONSTRATE** that these practices can work successfully and cost-effectively in our own operation
3. **PROPAGATE** the adoption of the best of these practices to the rest of the public service to accelerate the digitalization of the government.


## Our Vision
#### The end goal is to have Singapore become a model of technology enabled government. 

A place where using government services is as quick and simple as a click of a button. A place where government operations are efficiently automated, improving reliability while freeing up human focus to tackle cases that slip through the cracks. Where data is freely accessible so that citizens and policymakers alike have a clear view to make informed decisions. Where healthcare becomes so efficient that no one ever gets diagnosed with a late stage disease. Where our legal system is so accessible that no one gets denied access to justice.


## Our Philosophy
