accomplishments: >-
  * Provided technical direction for Vault and data.gov.sg by working on
  approaches for various epics, including designing the DGS backend around a
  serverless stack, search as a standalone service, experimentation with
  CodeBuild Jobs for long-running tasks, seamless traffic redirection, and
  pre-emptive metadata migration away from DynamoDB.

  * Provided team leadership by setting up on-call and production support rotation model for Vault team to address knowledge silos and maintenance work distribution

  * Diagnosed the root cause of Vault 1.0 admin dashboard inability to load being the rapid expansion of audit logs and automated the transfer of API-generated logs to CloudWatch, reducing the amount of logs by 90% and restoring services back to normal.
