accomplishments: >-
  * Grew the People team from an individual contributor practice to a team of 4
  today

  * Helped to scale OGP from 25 (2019) to >170 (2023)

  * Worked on organisation design shifts and levers (e.g. compensation schemes, performance management, management practices, resource allocation) to adapt to OGP's shifting organisation size and context
quote: I joined OGP in 2019, and have stayed since then because I think it is
  the governmentâ€™s best shot today at breaking the mould on trying new ways for
  government organisations to work better, so that we can be a better public
  service.
