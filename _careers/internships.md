### What does an internship with OGP mean?
Learning first

Plugging people into real world tasks

Treating interns like full-timers, regardless of their background
- We are open to Pre-U students to career switchers


### **What do our interns do?**

At Open Government Products, we value our interns and go great lengths to provide meaningful learning opportunities. You will be working closely with our full-time staff to contribute to existing projects. You can also prototype your own projects if you have ideas on how Singapore can be served best! Our interns take ownership of their work - and they pride themselves in doing work that serves our nation well.

Whether you aspire to be part of a [Corporate Team](/careers/corporate-team/) running tech organisations, or building tech for public good as a [Software Engineer](/careers/software-engineer/), [Product Designer](/careers/product-designer/), or [Product Manager](/careers/product-manager/), you will have the opportunity to contribute your skills, specialties, and ideas the same way our full-timers do.

### **What it is like working here**

**Rapid Prototyping** - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.

**Ownership** - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having opinions on what is being done and having ideas on what should be done next. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.

**Continuous Learning** - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

### **What we look for in our interns**

We believe in hiring good people and treating them well. This means we look at much more than just your ability to do the work. We particularly value internship applicants who:

* Show great promise in their chosen field - Personal projects and prior work count for much more than specific degrees or "papers".

* Communicate well - We work closely as a team so you need to be able to not just solve problems, but have other people understand your solutions.

* Take initiative to make things happen - Our job is to push for change in government, so we need to challenge the status quo and not wait for instruction.

* Want to work for the public good - We are public servants, we serve the public. This sometimes means ignoring political pressures and misguided policies. We need people who will push back if something is not in the public interest.

* Have strong, well thought-out values - We love it when you have a vision for a "perfect" Singapore. The ideas and insights you bring will only help our work to become more relevant, more effective, and more appropriate.

### **Internship positions currently open**

* Software Engineer interns for off-cycle internships (anytime in the year, minimum duration of 10 weeks)

* Product Designer interns (anytime in the year, minimum 3 month duration)
