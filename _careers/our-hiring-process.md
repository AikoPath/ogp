### How do we run our hiring process?


We want to respect the time and effort you put in  throughout the hiring process. There are generally up to 4 rounds of assessment (including screening) for most permanent roles, and 2 rounds for internships. Our end-to-end hiring process typically takes 3-5 weeks. Our assessments focus on real-world workpieces such as portfolios, skill-based tests, and written assignments. We ask specific role-based questions to assess how well you’d do on the job rather than how well you interview. You will be assessed and offered terms based on your market worth and not your employment history.



### What do we look for in candidates?
  

We define levels of impact we would expect someone to make at different levels of their function, and assess candidates directly against this. Broadly, we assess any potential employee on 4 core attributes - ability, initiative, communication, and values:

#### Ability

**What this is:** How competent is the individual in their technical field? 

**Why this is important:** Our mission is to build tech for public good. This requires having people who not only care about what they do, but are good at it. We need people who are excellent in each of their fields to come together and contribute toward our mission.
 
#### Initiative

**What this is**: How proactive is the candidate at pushing for change and solving problems where there are no clear instructions?

  
**Why this is important:** Initiative is a non-negotiable to get things done by pushing for change, and solving problems where there aren’t readily available solutions. We need people who have a strong internal drive, and are comfortable working in an environment with more problems to be solved than directions to be given.

**

#### Communication

**What this is:** How well can the individual talk and reason about their work to others both within and outside their functional area?

  

**Why this is important:** We work in lean, cross-functional teams that require communication within and across officers' domain of expertise. In pushing for change and working quickly in high-performing teams, we run as well as the poorest communicator in the room. We need people who can communicate well not just to be understood, but to influence and push for change within and beyond OGP.


#### Values

**What this is:** How much does the candidate desire to work on bringing about change for public good?

**Why this is important:** We exist to deliver public good through technology. We need all members of our team to get behind our mission and work toward this common goal. We need people who care about working on something beyond themselves, and show this passion for public good through their thoughts and actions.







### What can you expect from working at OGP?
Your contribution is measured in the impact you create, not the number of hours you sit at your desk. You can look forward to a young and dynamic team that works with a flat hierarchy where everyone is given the autonomy to maximise the impact of their work.
