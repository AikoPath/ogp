Hiring is the single most important thing we do. We believe in bringing in great people, and then giving them the autonomy to work on building tech for public good. 

Because hiring is so important, we run a hiring process focused on being fair, thorough, and transparent. We do so because we want candidates to show up at their best, and for us and our candidates to make the right call on whether we’re a good fit for one another.

### Our hiring process principles

Whilst our specific hiring process varies between roles, we hold a common philosophy for how we want our prospective employees to experience our hiring process:

**You will have full knowledge of what we’re looking for, and how your assessment went.** Candidates should have what they need to prepare, so they can show up and interview at their best. To do so, we share details on what to expect for every interview stage and what we are looking for. We offer and provide feedback if requested for every candidate who has had at least one interview with us, so candidates know where to improve. 

**Your time should be respected through the hiring process.** Our candidates take time off from their busy schedules to meet us, and we don’t believe in taking this courtesy for granted. We run efficient screening processes so as to let candidates know early on if we don’t think they’re a good fit. Our interviews are time-bound so as to be respectful of the time that candidates have set aside for our assessment process. We typically run 3-4 assessment rounds for each role (2 for internships), and get back to candidates within 3-5 weeks. Our assessment timeline depends mainly on scheduling as well as time candidates need to complete assignments. We are happy to fast track processes for any candidate who need urgent responses - our record so far is 7 days from application to offer. 

**You will be evaluated on real-world performance relevant to the role, and not arbitrary nor theoretical brainteasers.** The best candidate assessments are ones which focus on how well a candidate would do in the job. To make these assessments, we focus on asking for and assessing realistic workpieces such as portfolios, skill-based tests, and written assignments. During the interview, we ask specific role-based questions to assess how well you’d do on the job. We do not ask ‘gotcha’ questions or arbitrary brainteasers, nor do we nitpick on candidates on matters irrelevant to the job.

**You will be assessed as fairly as possible by multiple independent assessors.** All assessments are inherently subjective. We want to make sure that we control for subjectivity, implicit bias, and individual tendencies between interviewers as much as possible. To do so, we run highly structured interviews focused on real-world tasks and structured questioning. For non-internship roles, we have multiple interviewers present at interview rounds, and expect every interviewer to complete an evaluation before discussing their conclusions with one another. We use structured evaluation processes and clear assessment rubrics for every interview, and discuss all evaluations before making a decision on candidates. 

**You will be assessed and offered terms based on your market worth and not your employment history.** Candidates should be hired and paid based on the job they are able to accomplish, and not on other extraneous factors such as their years of experience, last drawn pay or education pedigree. To do so, we assess candidates against well-defined career schemas for each job function. We make offers to candidates based on their assessed level in the career schema, and also move to promote employees as quickly as possible to their assessed level of performance. We do not ask for your last-drawn salary, and weight demonstrated expertise and proven ability more so than factors like your education qualifications.

### What do we look for in candidates?

We assess any potential OGP employee on 4 core attributes typically referred to as AICV - that is, Ability, Initiative, Communication, and Values. 

#### Ability 
*How competent is the individual in their technical field? *

Our mission is to build tech for public good. This requires having people who not only care about what they do, but are good at it. We need people who are excellent in each of their fields to come together and contribute toward our mission.

#### Initiative 
*How proactive is the candidate at pushing for change and solving problems where there are no clear instructions?*

Initiative is a non-negotiable to get things done by pushing for change, and solving problems where there aren’t readily available solutions. We need people who have a strong internal drive, and are comfortable working in an environment with more problems to be solved than directions to be given. 	

#### Communication 
*How well can the individual talk and reason about their work to others both within and outside their functional area?*

We work in lean, cross-functional teams that require communication within and across officers' domain of expertise. In pushing for change and working quickly in high-performing teams, we run as well as the poorest communicator in the room. We need people who can communicate well not just to be understood, but to influence and push for change within and beyond OGP.

#### Values 
*How much does the candidate desire to work on bringing about change for public good?*

We exist to deliver public good through technology. We need all members of our team to get behind our mission and work toward this common goal. We need people who care about working on something beyond themselves, and show this passion for public good through their thoughts and actions.
