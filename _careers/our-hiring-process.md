Hiring is the single most important thing we do. We believe in bringing in great people, and then giving them the autonomy to work on building tech for public good.

Line on because it's important, we focus on running a hiring process that helps candidates be at their best, and to we can figure out fit both-ways.

*How we run hiring*

Alternatively, hiring principles:
- Efficient screening, thorough assessment
	- Process to expect
	- For full-timers, expect 1-2 video task/screening rounds, before 2-3 assessment interview rounds
	- Total time averages 3-5 weeks (faster for internships), but is mainly dependent on interview scheduling and the time it takes for candidates to complete assignments (we've done a full process within a week before!)

Rough diagram on what our process looks like

- Focus on real-world performance
	- Focus on real world tasks

One to two liner that we don't do brainteasers, or any gotcha questions. We tell candidates exactly what we are looking for, and give them messy open ended tasks without one single right answer. We want to see how people think, and perform on the job.

- Control for bias and blindspots
	- Multiple interviewers with structured interview approaches
	- Independent assessments and evaluation syncs with rubrics and schemas

Interviews can be subjective, bla bla 

- Candidates at their best
	- All info on what we are looking for, how we will run the interviews provided
	- Feedback offered for all people who move to interview round onwards

Interviews ARE stressful.  Here's how we try to help.
