> Hiring is the single most important thing we do. 

We believe in bringing in great people, and then giving them the autonomy to work on building tech for public good. 

Because hiring is so important, we run a hiring process focused on being fair, thorough, and transparent. We do so because we want candidates to show up at their best, and for us and our candidates to make the right call on whether we’re a good fit for one another.

### How do we run our hiring processes?

Whilst our specific hiring process varies between roles, we hold a common philosophy for how we want our prospective employees to experience our hiring process:

**You will have full knowledge of what we’re looking for, and how your assessment went.** 
* You should have what you need to prepare, so that you can show up and interview at your best. 
* We share details on what to expect for every interview stage and what we are looking for. 
* We offer and provide feedback if requested for every candidate who has had at least one interview with us, so you know where to improve. 

**Your time should be respected through the hiring process.** 
* Our candidates take time off from their busy schedules to meet us, and we don’t believe in taking this courtesy for granted. 
* We run efficient screening processes so as to let candidates know early on if we don’t think they’re a good fit. 
* Our interviews are time-bound so as to be respectful of the time that candidates have set aside for our assessment process. 
* We typically run 3-4 assessment rounds for each role (2 for internships), and get back to candidates within 3-5 weeks. 
* Our assessment timeline depends mainly on scheduling as well as time candidates need to complete assignments. 
* We are happy to fast track processes for any candidate who need urgent responses - our record so far is 7 days from application to offer. 

**You will be evaluated on real-world performance relevant to the role, and not arbitrary nor theoretical brainteasers.** 
* The best candidate assessments are ones which focus on how well a candidate would do in the job. 
* We focus on asking you for and assessing realistic workpieces such as portfolios, skill-based tests, and written assignments. 
* During the interview, we ask specific role-based questions to assess how well you’d do on the job. We do not ask ‘gotcha’ questions or arbitrary brainteasers, nor do we nitpick on candidates on matters irrelevant to the job.

**You will be assessed as fairly as possible by multiple independent assessors.** 
* All assessments are inherently subjective. We want to make sure that we control for subjectivity, implicit bias, and individual tendencies between interviewers as much as possible. 
* We run highly structured interviews focused on real-world tasks and structured questioning. 
* For non-internship roles, we have multiple interviewers present at interview rounds, and expect every interviewer to complete an evaluation before discussing their conclusions with one another. 
* We use structured evaluation processes and clear assessment rubrics for every interview, and discuss all evaluations before making a decision on candidates. 

**You will be assessed and offered terms based on your market worth and not your employment history.** 
* You should be hired and paid based on the job you are able to accomplish, and not on other extraneous factors such as your years of experience, last drawn pay or education pedigree. 
* We assess you against well-defined career schemas for each job function. We make offers based on your assessed level in the career schema. 
* Once hired, we move to promote people as quickly as possible to their assessed level of performance. We do not ask for your last-drawn salary. 
* We weight demonstrated expertise and proven ability more so than factors like your education qualifications.
