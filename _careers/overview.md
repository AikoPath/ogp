### **Who We Are**
Open Government Products is an in-house team of engineers, designers, and product managers who build technology for the public good. We proactively identify areas where technology can help, test our prototypes with actual users, and bring our best ones to launch. This includes everything from building better frontend applications for citizens, to automating the internal operations of public agencies. We use and release open source software, keep a flat hierarchy, and bypass bureaucracy to focus on delivery. We work on real problems, build for the user, and push for change.

Projects we have worked on include:

**Data.gov.sg** - An open repository of all the Singapore Governmentâ€™s public data. It helps people understand the data using visualizations and articles, and provides real-time APIs for developers to use.

**Beeline** - A data-driven shuttle bus platform. Bus routes are created from user suggestions and public transport usage data. Users can book, pay for, and track rides using a mobile app.

**Parking.sg** - A mobile app alternative to parking coupons. It lets users pay, extend, and refund their parking sessions just using their phones.

**Form.sg** - A form builder tool for agencies to self-service and create online forms that capture classified data, with the goal of replacing paper forms.
